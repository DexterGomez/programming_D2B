# Programming_D2B

This is the repository of the programming subject of the Data Engineering career of the Universidad Politénica de Yucatán, the objective of the subject is to obtain the ability to code computational algorithms through the structured programming paradigm to solve problems.

## Learning objectives
	
### L1.2 Introduction to C programming (Actitivy1_2)

- Write simple computer programs in C. 
- Describe concepts related to structured programming including: identifiers, variables, constants, reserved words.

- Use simple input and output statements.
- Use arithmetic and logical operators.

### L2.1 Selection Control Structures (Activity2_1)

- Simple conditional (if statement)
- Double conditional (if-else statement)
- Multiple conditional (switch statement)

### L2.2 Repetition Control Structures (Acitivity2_2)

- While
- Do-While
- For
